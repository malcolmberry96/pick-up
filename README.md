# Pick-Up

Created during weeks 22-24 of the Univerislty of Texas' Coding Bootcamp in Houston,TX 

This apllication primary purpose is to make casual shipping more convient. Not having a truck can be a major inconvenience when 
it comes to those one-off moments when you need to bring that new bed you brought home from Ikea or a couch from a flea-market find. 
If you have had any experience with hotshot trucking—a type of on-demand trucking—you may have found the process to be a little antiquated. 
With Pick-Up, we aim to birng on-demand trucking into the 21st century with a convnient application that allows users to easily summon a truck of any
size, keep track of them using Google Maps, and eliminate the outdated scheduled pick-up format. If you're a hotshot driver, this application
allows you to sign up and make quick money picking up and dropping off local orders around you.
